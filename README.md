# ABAP_PROJECTS

*Repository for Projects based on ABAP programming language.*

## Motivation for doing a Project based Repository

The motivation for creating the current repository was our desire to share our knowledge and our progress in ABAP.
We would be very happy if through this initiative, we could help ABAPers to develop their skills and improve their productivity
We strongly believe that because there are not many ABAP developers, our libraries must be shared. Furthermore, using some of our
projects, functional consultants can also be benefit
Any suggestions are always welcome regarding code optimization, addition of new functions or even ideas for projects.

## Contributors-Developers

The repository was created by George Drakos and Dimitris Valouxis. We are both ABAP developers 
seeking to learn and develop our skills in ABAP area. 

## Design Goals

* Copy-Paste Installation
* Code based on New ABAP Syntax. 7.40 and later

## Project 1: Dynamic SALV

Display any table using cl_salv_Table alv. Scope of this project is to create a cl_salv_table based alv which is
as dynamic as possible. There are no data declarations(wherever possible), no custom screen, no gui status etc.
Also many custom functions have been added to ALV toolbar like custom details screen( se16n inspired ), 
hide/show empty columns of table and edit button. The whole point of this project is to reveal the real potential of 
cl_salv_table based ALV even though there are limitations compared to cl_gui_alv_grid.

## Project 2: Transport Request Utility

Heads up functional consultants. This one is built in order to assist you in your every daily request transports.
It is under construction so stay tuned...
